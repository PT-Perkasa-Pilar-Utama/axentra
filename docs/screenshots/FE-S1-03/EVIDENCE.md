Setup deviations (recorded for the Tech Lead):

- Web runs on port 5174 (Vite --strictPort). Port 5173 was already held by an unrelated bun process (not touched).
- Seeded users were created by db:seed in the E2E DB. Their plaintext passwords are not in the repo, so the run used a shell-level override of AUTH_LOCAL_IDENTITY_DIRECTORY with generated test passwords. .env and the repo were not modified.
- The E2E DB category download flag was changed for the denial and enable steps (see BE-S3-02 and FE-S3-02).
- Playwright could only read/write files under its allowed root, so fixtures were copied there for the run and removed afterwards.
